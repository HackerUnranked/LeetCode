# **Arrays**

1. **#1 Two Sum** - Find indices of two numbers such that they add up to a
   specific target.
2. **#121 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** - Maximize profit by choosing a
   single day to buy one stock and another day in the future to sell that stock.
3. **#217 Contains Duplicate** - Check if any value appears at least twice in
   the array.
4. **#53 Maximum Subarray** - Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least
   one number) which has the largest sum.
5. **#88 Merge Sorted Array** - Merge two sorted arrays into one.
6. **#118 Pascal's Triangle** - Generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
7. **#167 Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted** - Similar to Two Sum, but the
   input array is sorted.
8. **#189 Rotate Array** - Rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is
   non-negative.
9. **#238 Product of Array Except Self** - Return an array output such that
   output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
10. **#287 Find the Duplicate Number** - Given an array nums containing n + 1
    integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at
    least one duplicate number must exist.
11. **#560 Subarray Sum Equals K** - Find the total number of continuous
    subarrays whose sum equals to k.
12. **#713 Subarray Product Less Than K** - Find the number of contiguous
    subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than
    k.
13. **#15 3Sum** - Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c
    in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which
    gives the sum of zero.
14. **#42 Trapping Rain Water** - Given n non-negative integers representing an
    elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it
    can trap after raining.
15. **#128 Longest Consecutive Sequence** - Given an unsorted array of integers
    nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
